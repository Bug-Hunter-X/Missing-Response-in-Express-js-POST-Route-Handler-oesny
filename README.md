This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where a route handler for POST requests lacks a response.  The bug.js file shows the problematic code. The bugSolution.js file provides the corrected version with proper response handling. This issue can lead to the client receiving no response or an error due to the incomplete HTTP transaction.
